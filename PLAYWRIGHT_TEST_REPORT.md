## Issue Resolution Summary

### Issue 1: Video Player Oversized ❌ → ✅

**Original Problem:**
- Video player was 535px tall on both `/movies` and `/series` pages
- Taking excessive vertical space, leaving minimal room for content
- Placeholder was visible but video element was forcing large height

**Root Cause:**
The Video.js player container had a default aspect ratio that was being applied even when the video wasn't playing. The placeholder overlay was correctly positioned, but the underlying video element was still taking up 535px of height.

**Solution Implemented:**
Modified `src/components/features/video-player.tsx` (lines 368-376):

```tsx
// BEFORE:
<div className="relative bg-black rounded-lg overflow-hidden h-full min-h-inherit">
  {isMounted && (
    <div data-vjs-player suppressHydrationWarning>
      <video ... />
    </div>
  )}

// AFTER:
<div className={cn(
  "relative bg-black rounded-lg overflow-hidden",
  showPlaceholder ? "h-[60px]" : "h-full min-h-[400px]"
)}>
  {isMounted && (
    <div
      data-vjs-player
      suppressHydrationWarning
      className={cn(showPlaceholder && "hidden")}
    >
      <video ... />
    </div>
  )}
```

**Changes:**
1. Added conditional height: `h-[60px]` when showing placeholder, `h-full min-h-[400px]` when playing
2. Added `hidden` class to video player wrapper when placeholder is shown
3. This ensures the video element doesn't affect layout when not in use

**Result:**
- ✅ Movies page: 62px (was 535px) - **88% reduction**
- ✅ Series page: 62px (was 522px) - **88% reduction**
- ✅ More content visible on screen (2-3 full rows of cards)
- ✅ Video element hidden when not playing (prevents layout issues)

---

### Issue 2: Connection State Persistence ✅

**Status:** Already working correctly

**Evidence:**
- Navigated from connection dialog → Movies page → Series page
- No connection dialog appeared on subsequent pages
- Auto-reconnect functionality working as designed
- Credentials stored in localStorage and reused

**Files Involved:**
- `src/components/providers/connection-provider.tsx` - Auto-reconnect on mount
- `src/store/connection.ts` - Reconnect logic
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - ConnectionProvider wrapper

---

### Issue 3: SSR "window is not defined" Errors ⚠️ → ✅

**Status:** Resolved after cache clear

**Original Problem:**
SSR errors in dev server logs showing:
```
⨯ ReferenceError: window is not defined
    at module evaluation (webpack://mpegts/webpack/universalModuleDefinition:10:4)
```

**Solution:**
The previous fix (dynamic mpegts.js import) was correct, but the cache was persisting old errors. After running:

```bash
rm -rf .next
pnpm run dev
```

**Result:**
- ✅ No SSR errors in fresh build
- ✅ mpegts.js loaded dynamically only on client-side
- ✅ Clean server logs
